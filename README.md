Salent features:

### How to use the bot
1. Send a message/ messages to the bot
2. Then click on the inline buttons given by the bot (I made this bot for my engineering college)
3. When you click on any button (say All 1st year), the message will be sent to that respective group/groups (for All 1st year it will be all the 1st year groups of all the departments)
4. You can then click on other buttons and forward the same message to other groups too.
5. Once done sending, click on 'Done' button and the message/messages will be cleared. Now you can send new set of messages which can be forwarded using the buttons.
6. Bot can even send images or other documents as well.
7. There is a 'delete send msg' button sent whenever a message is sent to the bot. Clicking on that button will delete that sent message from the database.
